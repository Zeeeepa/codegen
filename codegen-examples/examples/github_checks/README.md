# GitHub Checks Example

This example demonstrates how to create a GitHub check that analyzes import cycles in a repository using the Codegen SDK and Modal. When a pull request is labeled, this application will:

1. Analyze the codebase for import cycles
2. Identify potentially problematic cycles with mixed static and dynamic imports
3. Post a comment on the pull request with the analysis results

## Prerequisites

- [Modal](https://modal.com/) account
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository access
- Python 3.13 or higher

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Zeeeepa/codegen.git
cd codegen/codegen-examples/examples/github_checks

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your credentials:

```
# GitHub credentials
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token

# Modal configuration (optional)
MODAL_API_KEY=your_modal_api_key
```

To get these credentials:

- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: Create a personal access token with repo permissions
- **MODAL_API_KEY**: Your Modal API key (if not using Modal CLI authentication)

### 3. Authenticate with Modal

```bash
modal token new
```

## Deployment Commands

### Deploy to Modal

```bash
# Deploy the application to Modal
./deploy.sh
```

This will deploy the application to Modal and provide you with a URL that you can use to configure the GitHub webhook.

### Get Deployment Status

```bash
# Check the status of your Modal deployment
modal app status codegen-import-cycles-github-check
```

### View Logs

```bash
# View logs from your Modal deployment
modal app logs codegen-import-cycles-github-check
```

### Update Deployment

```bash
# Update your Modal deployment after making changes
./deploy.sh
```

### Stop Deployment

```bash
# Stop your Modal deployment
modal app stop codegen-import-cycles-github-check
```

## Configuring GitHub Webhooks

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Go to Settings â†’ Webhooks
3. Click "Add webhook"
4. Enter the URL provided by Modal when you deployed the application
5. Select "application/json" as the content type
6. Select "Let me select individual events"
7. Check "Pull requests"
8. Click "Add webhook"

## Usage

1. Create a pull request in your repository
2. Add a label to the pull request
3. The application will automatically:
   - Analyze the codebase for import cycles
   - Identify potentially problematic cycles
   - Post a comment on the pull request with the analysis results

## Customizing the Application

You can customize the application by modifying the following functions in `app.py`:

- `create_graph_from_codebase`: Creates a directed graph representing import relationships
- `find_import_cycles`: Identifies strongly connected components (cycles) in the import graph
- `find_problematic_import_loops`: Identifies cycles with both static and dynamic imports

## Troubleshooting

- **Webhook not receiving events**: Verify that your GitHub webhook is configured correctly and that the URL is accessible.
- **Authentication errors**: Check that your GITHUB_TOKEN is correct and has the necessary permissions.
- **Modal deployment issues**: Run `modal app logs codegen-import-cycles-github-check` to view logs and diagnose issues.
