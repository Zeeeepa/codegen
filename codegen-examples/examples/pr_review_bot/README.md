# PR Review Bot Example

This example demonstrates how to create a GitHub Pull Request review bot using the Codegen SDK and Modal. The bot automatically reviews pull requests and provides feedback on code quality, potential issues, and suggestions for improvement.

## Prerequisites

- [Modal](https://modal.com/) account
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository access
- Python 3.13 or higher
- Codegen SDK (version 0.52.19 or higher)

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Zeeeepa/codegen.git
cd codegen/codegen-examples/examples/pr_review_bot

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your credentials:

```
# GitHub credentials
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token

# Modal configuration (optional)
MODAL_API_KEY=your_modal_api_key
```

### 3. Authenticate with Modal

```bash
modal token new
```

## Deployment Commands

### Deploy to Modal

```bash
# Deploy the application to Modal
./deploy.sh
```

This will deploy the application to Modal and provide you with a URL that you can use to configure the GitHub webhook.

### Get Deployment Status

```bash
# Check the status of your Modal deployment
modal app status pr-review-bot
```

### View Logs

```bash
# View logs from your Modal deployment
modal app logs pr-review-bot
```

### Update Deployment

```bash
# Update your Modal deployment after making changes
./deploy.sh
```

### Stop Deployment

```bash
# Stop your Modal deployment
modal app stop pr-review-bot
```

## Configuring GitHub Webhooks

1. Go to your GitHub repository
1. Go to Settings â†’ Webhooks
1. Click "Add webhook"
1. Enter the URL provided by Modal when you deployed the application
1. Select "application/json" as the content type
1. Select "Let me select individual events"
1. Check "Pull requests"
1. Click "Add webhook"

## Usage

The PR review bot automatically reviews pull requests when they are opened or updated. It provides feedback on:

- Code quality
- Potential bugs
- Security issues
- Performance concerns
- Documentation
- Testing

The bot posts its review as a comment on the pull request.

## Customizing the Application

You can customize the application by modifying the following files:

- `app.py`: The main application file that handles GitHub webhook events
- `helpers.py`: Helper functions for analyzing code and generating reviews

## Troubleshooting

- **Webhook not receiving events**: Verify that your GitHub webhook is configured correctly and that the URL is accessible.
- **Authentication errors**: Check that your GITHUB_TOKEN is correct and has the necessary permissions.
- **Modal deployment issues**: Run `modal app logs pr-review-bot` to view logs and diagnose issues.
