# Issues Module

This module provides a comprehensive framework for detecting, tracking, and managing code issues across the codebase.

## Key Components

- **Issue Model**: Standardized representation of code issues with severity, category, location, and other metadata.
- **Issue Collection**: Container for managing groups of issues with filtering and reporting capabilities.
- **Issue Analyzer**: Base class for analyzers that detect and report issues.

## Issue Categories

The module supports various issue categories including:

- Code quality issues (dead code, complexity, style)
- Type and parameter issues
- Implementation issues
- Dependency issues
- API issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues

## Usage

Issues can be created, tracked, and reported through the provided APIs:

```python
from codegen_on_oss.analyzers.issues import Issue, IssueSeverity, IssueCategory, CodeLocation

# Create an issue
issue = Issue(
    message="Function is too complex",
    severity=IssueSeverity.WARNING,
    location=CodeLocation(file="path/to/file.py", line=42),
    category=IssueCategory.COMPLEXITY,
    suggestion="Consider refactoring into smaller functions"
)

# Add to collection
collection = IssueCollection()
collection.add_issue(issue)

# Generate report
report = collection.statistics()
```

## Integration

This module is designed to integrate with other analyzers to provide a unified issue reporting system across different types of analysis.
