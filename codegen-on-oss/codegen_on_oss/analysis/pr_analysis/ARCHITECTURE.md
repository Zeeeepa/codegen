## Component Responsibilities

### Core Components

1. **PRAnalyzer**
   - Main orchestrator for PR analysis
   - Coordinates the analysis process
   - Initializes and manages other components
   - Provides high-level API for analysis

2. **AnalysisContext**
   - Stores shared state for analysis
   - Provides access to repository and PR data
   - Holds configuration settings
   - Shared across all components

3. **RuleEngine**
   - Manages analysis rules
   - Loads rules from configuration
   - Runs rules and collects results
   - Provides rule lifecycle management

### Git Components

1. **GitHubClient**
   - Wrapper around PyGithub
   - Provides access to GitHub API
   - Retrieves repository and PR data
   - Posts comments to GitHub

2. **RepoOperator**
   - Wrapper around GitPython
   - Clones and updates repositories
   - Checks out branches and PRs
   - Provides access to local repository

3. **Models**
   - Data models for Git entities
   - Repository model
   - Pull request model
   - Commit model

### Rule Components

1. **BaseRule**
   - Base class for all rules
   - Defines rule interface
   - Provides common functionality
   - Handles rule configuration

2. **Specific Rules**
   - Code integrity rules
   - Parameter validation rules
   - Implementation validation rules
   - Each rule focuses on a specific aspect of code quality

### Reporting Components

1. **ReportGenerator**
   - Generates analysis reports
   - Aggregates rule results
   - Creates summary and details
   - Formats reports for different outputs

2. **ReportFormatter**
   - Formats reports for different outputs
   - Markdown formatter for GitHub
   - HTML formatter for web display
   - JSON formatter for API responses

3. **Visualization**
   - Creates visualizations of analysis results
   - Charts and graphs
   - Trend analysis
   - Comparative visualizations

### Utility Components

1. **ConfigUtils**
   - Loads and saves configuration
   - Merges configurations from different sources
   - Provides default configuration
   - Handles environment variables

2. **DiffUtils**
   - Analyzes code diffs
   - Extracts changed lines
   - Identifies added, modified, and deleted code
   - Provides context for changes

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**
   - PRAnalyzer is created with configuration
   - GitHubClient and RepoOperator are initialized
   - Repository and PR data are retrieved
   - AnalysisContext is created with this data

2. **Repository Preparation**
   - RepoOperator clones or updates the repository
   - PR branch is checked out
   - Local repository is prepared for analysis

3. **Rule Execution**
   - RuleEngine loads rules from configuration
   - Each rule is executed with the context
   - Rule results are collected and aggregated

4. **Report Generation**
   - ReportGenerator creates a report from rule results
   - Report is formatted for the desired output
   - Visualizations are generated if requested

5. **Result Posting**
   - Formatted report is posted to GitHub as a comment
   - Or saved to a file
   - Or returned as API response

## Extension Points

The system is designed to be extensible in several ways:

1. **New Rules**
   - Create new rule classes that inherit from BaseRule
   - Implement the run() method with rule logic
   - Add the rule to the configuration

2. **New Report Formats**
   - Add new formatters to ReportFormatter
   - Implement formatting logic for the new format
   - Update configuration to use the new format

3. **New Visualizations**
   - Add new visualization methods to Visualization
   - Implement visualization logic
   - Update report generation to include the new visualization

4. **New Git Providers**
   - Create new client classes for other Git providers
   - Implement the same interface as GitHubClient
   - Update PRAnalyzer to use the new client
