# Codegen Visualization Testing Plan

This directory contains the comprehensive testing and validation plan for the enhanced visualization features in the Codegen repository.

## Overview

The Codegen visualization system provides powerful capabilities for visualizing code structure, dependencies, and relationships. This testing plan ensures these features work correctly, perform well, and provide a consistent experience across different programming languages and codebase sizes.

## Contents

1. **[Visualization Testing Plan](visualization_testing_plan.md)**: Comprehensive overview of the testing approach, covering functional testing, cross-language compatibility, performance benchmarking, and UI/UX validation.

2. **[Test Implementation Details](test_implementation_details.md)**: Detailed implementation plans for testing each visualization component, including specific test cases and example code.

3. **[Test Execution Plan](test_execution_plan.md)**: Timeline, resource allocation, and prioritization for executing the test plan.

4. **Sample Test Implementations**:
   - [Sample Base Visualizer Tests](sample_test_base_visualizer.py): Example implementation of unit tests for the base visualizer class.
   - [Sample Performance Benchmark Tests](sample_benchmark_tests.py): Example implementation of performance benchmark tests for visualization features.
   - [Sample Cross-Language Tests](sample_cross_language_tests.py): Example implementation of cross-language compatibility tests.

## Key Testing Areas

1. **Functional Testing**: Ensures all visualization types work correctly and produce expected outputs.
2. **Cross-Language Compatibility**: Validates visualization features work consistently across Python, TypeScript, and other languages.
3. **Performance Testing**: Measures and optimizes visualization performance with different codebase sizes.
4. **UI/UX Testing**: Validates interactive features and user experience.
5. **Edge Case Testing**: Tests visualization with complex code structures and unusual patterns.

## Test Implementation Strategy

The test implementation follows a hierarchical approach:

1. **Base Visualizer Tests**: Tests for the core visualization functionality.
2. **Specialized Visualizer Tests**: Tests for specific visualization types.
3. **Integration Tests**: Tests for visualization pipeline and cross-language compatibility.
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks for different codebase sizes and configurations.
5. **UI Tests**: Tests for interactive features and browser compatibility.

## Running the Tests

Once implemented, the tests can be run using pytest:

```bash
# Run all visualization tests
pytest tests/unit/visualizations/ tests/integration/visualizations/

# Run performance benchmarks
pytest tests/benchmarks/visualizations/ --benchmark-save=visualization_benchmarks

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/visualizations/test_base_visualizer.py
```

## Test Reporting

Test results will be documented in the following formats:

1. **Test Coverage Report**: Generated using pytest-cov.
2. **Performance Benchmark Report**: Generated using pytest-benchmark.
3. **Bug Report**: Standard format for reporting visualization issues.
4. **Test Summary Dashboard**: Overview of all test results.

## Contributing

When adding new visualization features, please follow these guidelines:

1. Add appropriate unit tests for new functionality.
2. Include performance benchmarks for features that may impact performance.
3. Test with different codebase sizes and languages.
4. Document any known limitations or edge cases.
