Every large codebase tells a story through its architecture. In this post, we'll explore one of the most interesting patterns in PyTorch's codebase: the topology of its imports and the cycles they create.

Using Codegen, we'll explore how PyTorch's modules interconnect, visualize its dependency patterns, and demonstrate how to safely refactor problematic import cycles. This isn't just about fixing bugs – it's about understanding how one of the world's most popular deep learning frameworks is structured, and how we can use modern tools to reason about and modify complex codebases.

## Understanding Import Topology

At its core, a Python codebase is a directed graph. Each file is a node, and imports create edges between these nodes. When these edges form cycles, we get what's known as import loops or circular dependencies.

Python's [import machinery](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html) is surprisingly sophisticated – it can handle many types of circular imports through its module caching system. For example, this common pattern works just fine:

```python
# module_a.py
def function_a():
    from module_b import function_b  # Dynamic import inside function
    return function_b()

# module_b.py
from module_a import function_a  # Static import at module level
```

But this flexibility is a double-edged sword. While Python can resolve many import cycles at runtime, they can create subtle performance issues and maintenance headaches. Each new import in a cycle adds complexity to the module initialization sequence, and a single poorly placed import can transform a "working" cycle into an unresolvable deadlock.

What makes PyTorch particularly interesting is how it manages this complexity at scale. Let's visualize its import topology and see what patterns emerge.

## Visualizing PyTorch's Import Graph with Codegen

[Codegen](/introduction/overview) is a Python library for programmatic codebase manipulation. We can use it to compute PyTorch's import graph as a [networkx](https://networkx.org/) graph then detect and visualize patterns, including loops.

The interesting thing about import cycles is that they often form clusters – groups of files that all depend on each other through various import chains. Using [Imports](/building-with-codegen/imports) and `networkx`'s [strongly_connected_components](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.components.strongly_connected_components.html), we can identify and analyze these clusters:

## Detecting Dynamic Imports

Not all import cycles are problematic! Some cycles using dynamic imports can work perfectly fine:

</Frame>

PyTorch prevents most circular import issues through dynamic imports which can be seen through the `import_symbol.is_dynamic` property. If any edge in a strongly connected component is dynamic, runtime conflicts are typically resolved.

However, we discovered an interesting import pattern between [`flex_decoding.py`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_inductor/kernel/flex_decoding.py) and [`flex_attention.py`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_inductor/kernel/flex_attention.py):

<img src="/images/problematic-import-loop.png" alt="Import pattern example" />

At first glance, it might seem odd that `flex_decoding.py` imports from `flex_attention.py` in two different ways:
```python
# Top-level imports for utility functions
from .flex_attention import (
    compute_forward_block_mn,
    compute_forward_inner,
    # ... more utility functions
)

def create_flex_decoding_kernel(*args, **kwargs):
    # Dynamic import for runtime-specific functionality
    from .flex_attention import set_head_dim_values
    # ... rest of function
```

But this pattern is actually quite thoughtful. The top-level imports are utility functions needed throughout the module, while `set_head_dim_values` is dynamically imported because it's only needed during kernel creation and might have its own complex dependencies. This separation helps manage initialization order and keeps the module's dependency graph cleaner.

Let's see how we can use Codegen to analyze more patterns like this across PyTorch's codebase:
