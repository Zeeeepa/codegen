Codegen enables you to build and deploy code-aware applications that integrate with your development workflow. Using the `CodegenApp` class, you can create services that respond to events from GitHub, Linear, and Slack - analyzing and manipulating code in response to real-world development activities.

# Getting Started

## Setting Up the App

First, create a `CodegenApp` instance:

```python
from codegen.extensions.events.app import CodegenApp

app = CodegenApp(name="pr-review-bot")
```

## Basic Event Handler

Here's a simple example of a GitHub PR review bot:

```python
@app.github.event("pull_request:opened")
def handle_pr_opened(event: dict, codebase):
    """Handle new pull request events"""
    pr_title = event["pull_request"]["title"]
    
    # Create an agent to analyze the PR
    agent = CodeAgent(codebase)
    review = agent.run(f"Review PR: {pr_title}")
    
    # Post results to Slack
    app.slack.client.chat_postMessage(
        channel="your-channel-id",
        text=f"PR Review: {review}"
    )
```

# Environment Setup

Before deploying, set up your environment variables:

```bash
# Required for deployment
MODAL_API_KEY="..."

# LLM Access
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."

# Platform Access (as needed)
CODEGEN_SECRETS__GITHUB_TOKEN="..."
LINEAR_ACCESS_TOKEN="..."
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="..."
```

# Available Platforms

Codegen supports event handling for:

- **GitHub**: PR events, issue comments, code pushes
- **Linear**: Issue creation, updates, comments
- **Slack**: Message events, app mentions, commands

See the platform-specific guides for detailed setup:
- [GitHub Integration](./github)
- [Linear Integration](./linear)
- [Slack Integration](./slack)

# Deployment with Modal

Codegen uses [Modal](https://modal.com) for deployment. Modal provides:
- Serverless execution
- Automatic scaling
- Environment management
- Webhook endpoints

# Best Practices

## Error Handling

Always wrap your event handler logic in try/except blocks:

```python
@app.github.event("pull_request:opened")
def handle_pr(event: dict, codebase):
    try:
        # Your handler logic
        agent = CodeAgent(codebase)
        result = agent.run("...")
        return {"status": "success", "result": result}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error handling PR: {e}")
        return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}
```

## Logging

Use the built-in logger for debugging and monitoring:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

@app.github.event("push")
def handle_push(event: dict):
    logger.info(f"Received push event: {event['ref']}")
    # Handler logic...
```

# Next Steps

- Set up [GitHub Integration](./github) for code review automation
- Configure [Linear Integration](./linear) for issue management
- Enable [Slack Integration](./slack) for chat interactions
