# How Codegen Works

Codegen is an expert software engineering agent designed to help development teams build better software. This document explains the architecture and workflow of Codegen.

## Architecture Overview

Codegen operates through a sophisticated system with several key components:

</Frame>

### Core Components

1. **Trigger System**
   - Monitors various channels (Slack, GitHub, Linear, API)
   - Detects when users mention or interact with Codegen
   - Captures context from the triggering environment

2. **Context Gathering**
   - Analyzes the codebase structure
   - Retrieves relevant information from integrations
   - Builds a comprehensive understanding of the task

3. **Task Planning**
   - Breaks down complex requests into actionable steps
   - Determines the optimal approach to solve the problem
   - Identifies required tools and resources

4. **Execution Engine**
   - Runs commands in a sandboxed environment
   - Makes code changes through precise edits
   - Interacts with external services via API

5. **Response Generation**
   - Creates clear, concise responses
   - Formats information appropriately for the channel
   - Provides links to relevant resources

## Workflow

When you interact with Codegen, the following process occurs:

1. **Trigger**: You mention Codegen in Slack, tag it in a GitHub PR, or interact with it in Linear
2. **Context Analysis**: Codegen gathers relevant information about your request
3. **Planning**: It determines the best approach to solve your problem
4. **Execution**: Codegen performs necessary actions (code analysis, edits, searches)
5. **Response**: It provides a helpful response in the same channel where you triggered it

## Available Tools

Codegen has access to a powerful set of tools:

### Code Analysis & Navigation
- Search codebases using text or regex patterns
- View file contents and metadata
- Analyze code structure and dependencies
- Reveal symbol definitions and usages

### File Operations
- View, create, edit, and delete files
- Rename files while updating all imports
- Move symbols between files
- Commit changes to disk

### Semantic Editing
- Make precise, context-aware code edits
- Analyze affected code structures
- Preview changes before applying
- Ensure code quality with linting

### Web Search
- Search the web for information
- View specific web pages for reference

### Integration Tools
- Create and manage GitHub issues and PRs
- Interact with Linear tickets
- Send messages in Slack
- And more...

## Best Practices for Working with Codegen

To get the most out of Codegen:

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly describe what you want Codegen to do
2. **Provide Context**: Mention relevant files, issues, or PRs
3. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Ask for one thing at a time for best results
4. **Review Changes**: Always review PRs created by Codegen before merging
5. **Provide Feedback**: Let Codegen know if its response was helpful

## Security and Privacy

Codegen operates with security as a priority:

- All code operations happen in isolated sandboxed environments
- Codegen only accesses repositories you've explicitly granted it access to
- Your code is never used to train AI models
- All operations follow the principle of least privilege

## Limitations

While powerful, Codegen has some limitations:

- It cannot access private networks or systems outside its integrations
- Very large codebases may take longer to analyze
- Complex architectural decisions still benefit from human oversight
- It works best with well-structured, documented code
