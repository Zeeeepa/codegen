1. Visit our Slack App Directory listing [coming soon]
2. Click "Add to Slack"
3. Select the workspace where you want to install the bot
4. Authorize the required permissions
5. Once installed, you'll see the bot in your workspace's apps

The bot will now be available in your Slack workspace. You can interact with it by mentioning `@botname` in any channel where it's present.

## Step 2: Configure GitHub Integration

GitHub integration allows the bot to interact with your repositories, create PRs, and provide code-related assistance.

1. Go to your Slack workspace settings
2. Navigate to the bot's configuration page
3. Click on "Connect GitHub"
4. Authorize the GitHub integration
5. Select the repositories you want the bot to have access to

## Step 3: Set Up Linear Integration (Optional)

Linear integration enables project management features and issue tracking capabilities.

1. In your Slack workspace settings
2. Go to the bot's configuration page
3. Click on "Connect Linear"
4. Authorize the Linear integration
5. Choose the teams and projects you want to connect

## Verification

To verify everything is working:

1. In Slack, type `@botname help` to see available commands
2. Try a simple GitHub command like `@botname list my PRs`
3. If you set up Linear, try `@botname show my tasks`
