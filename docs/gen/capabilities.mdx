Codegen is powered by a suite of specialized tools that enable it to interact with your development environment and provide intelligent assistance. This page details the tools available to Codegen and how they enhance your workflow.

## Core Agent

At the heart of Codegen is a powerful AI code agent that can analyze, understand, and manipulate codebases. The agent combines large language model capabilities with specialized tools to provide intelligent code assistance. It can:

- Analyze and understand complex codebases
- Make intelligent code edits and refactoring suggestions
- Handle code organization and dependency management
- Generate and update documentation
- Assist with debugging and problem-solving

  Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/build-code-agent) to learn how to create custom
  agents using our open-source SDK!

## How Codegen Uses These Tools

Codegen's AI brain (powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet) intelligently selects and combines these tools to:

1. Understand your requests through natural language in Slack
2. Determine the most appropriate tools to fulfill your request
3. Execute the necessary actions across GitHub, Linear, and your codebase
4. Provide clear, helpful responses back in Slack

This seamless integration allows you to manage your entire development workflow through simple conversations, without having to switch between different platforms and interfaces.
