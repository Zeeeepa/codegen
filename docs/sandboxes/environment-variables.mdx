Codegen sandboxes come pre-configured with a set of environment variables to facilitate common development tasks and ensure smooth operation of tools and package managers. Understanding these variables can be helpful when debugging or customizing setup scripts.

## Standard Environment Variables

The following environment variables are typically available within Codegen sandboxes:

| Variable                          | Default Value                                 | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NVM_DIR`                         | _Dynamic_                                     | Specifies the directory where Node Version Manager (NVM) is installed. The exact path is set during sandbox initialization.                 |
| `PATH`                            | _Dynamic (includes NVM Node version)_         | The system's execution search path. It's augmented to include the `bin` directory of the currently active Node.js version (managed by NVM). |
| `NVM_BIN`                         | _Dynamic (points to active Node version bin)_ | Points to the `bin` directory of the currently active Node.js version. This is also set dynamically by NVM.                                 |
| `NODE_VERSION`                    | _Dynamic (current NVM Node version)_          | Indicates the version of Node.js that is currently active in the sandbox, as managed by NVM.                                                |
| `NODE_OPTIONS`                    | `"--max-old-space-size=8192"`                 | Configures V8 to allow a max old space size of 8192MB. Useful for memory-intensive Node.js apps.                                            |
| `DEBIAN_FRONTEND`                 | `"noninteractive"`                            | Instructs Debian-based package managers (like `apt`) to run without interactive prompts.                                                    |
| `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`                | `"1"`                                         | Forces `stdout` and `stderr` for Python to be unbuffered, meaning output is written immediately.                                            |
| `COREPACK_ENABLE_DOWNLOAD_PROMPT` | `"0"`                                         | Disables the Corepack prompt when it needs to download a package manager (like Yarn or pnpm).                                               |
| `PYTHONPATH`                      | `"/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages"`   | Adds the specified directory to Python's module search path. (Python version may vary).                                                     |
| `IS_SANDBOX`                      | `"true"`                                      | A boolean flag indicating the environment is a Codegen sandbox.                                                                             |
| `NPM_CONFIG_YES`                  | `"true"`                                      | Configures npm to automatically answer "yes" to prompts.                                                                                    |
| `PIP_NO_INPUT`                    | `"1"`                                         | Instructs pip (Python's package installer) to operate in non-interactive mode.                                                              |
| `YARN_ENABLE_IMMUTABLE_INSTALLS`  | `"false"`                                     | Disables Yarn's "immutable installs" feature, allowing `yarn install` to modify the lockfile.                                               |

<Note>
  The values for variables like `NVM_DIR`, `PATH`, `NVM_BIN`, and `NODE_VERSION`
  are typically set dynamically during the sandbox setup process, depending on
  the specific NVM and Node.js versions being used. The `PYTHONPATH` may also
  vary based on the Python installation within the sandbox.
