Manage environment variables and secrets for your repository. These are securely injected into the agent's sandbox environment during code execution.

<Warning>
  Only use staging credentials and non-production secrets. Never store
  production API keys, database passwords, or sensitive credentials.
</Warning>

## How Secrets Work

Repository secrets are environment variables that get automatically injected into the sandbox when agents execute code:

- **Secure Storage:** Secrets are encrypted and stored securely per repository
- **Sandbox Injection:** Automatically available as environment variables during agent execution
- **Development Support:** Enable agents to run dev servers, connect to staging databases, and test integrations

## Common Use Cases

- **Development Server Credentials:** API keys for staging services and development APIs
- **Database Connections:** Connection strings for staging/test databases
- **Third-Party Integrations:** Non-production tokens for services like Stripe test mode, staging analytics
- **Build Configuration:** Environment-specific build variables and feature flags

## Managing Secrets

Add secrets through your repository settings:

1. Navigate to your repository settings
2. Go to the Secrets tab
3. Add key-value pairs for your environment variables
4. Secrets are immediately available to agents in the sandbox

<Note>
  Agents can access these secrets when running code, starting development
  servers, or executing tests that require environment configuration.
