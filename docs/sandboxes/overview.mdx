Codegen agents operate within secure, isolated sandbox environments where they can safely execute code, install dependencies, and run commands without affecting your local machine or production systems.

## Capabilities

Each sandbox provides a controlled environment with:

- **File System Access:** Read, write, and modify files within the sandbox's temporary file system.
- **Terminal Access:** Execute shell commands (`bash`, `sh`, etc.) to run scripts, linters, formatters, build tools, and other necessary commands.
- **Process Execution:** Run code in various languages (Python, Node.js, etc., depending on the sandbox image).
- **Networking:** Controlled network access for tasks like installing packages or fetching data (can be restricted).

## How Agents Use Sandboxes

Agents utilize sandboxes for a variety of tasks:

- **Testing Code:** Running unit tests, integration tests, or linters against the code they've written or modified.
- **Verifying Changes:** Executing the code to ensure it runs correctly before committing.
- **Installing Dependencies:** Using package managers (`pip`, `npm`, `yarn`) to install necessary libraries.
- **Running Tools:** Executing build scripts, code formatters, or other development utilities.

## Configuration

Sandboxes are typically configured per-agent run or defined within your Codegen settings. You often don't need to manage them directly, but advanced configurations might allow specifying Docker images or environment variables.

<Note>
  Sandboxes are ephemeral; their state is not typically persisted between agent
  runs unless specifically configured for caching or stateful operations.
