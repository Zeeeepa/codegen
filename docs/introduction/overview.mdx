**Meet Codegen: AI agents for your codebase.**

We provide intelligent **Code Agents** that act as partners in your development workflow, understanding, modifying, and managing codebases on your behalf.

Our mission is to enable AI agents to collaborate seamlessly with developers, automating tasks and accelerating software creation.

## What Can Codegen Agents Do?

Codegen agents leverage powerful tools to interact with code, allowing them to:

-   **Understand Code:** Explain functions, summarize changes, trace dependencies.
-   **Modify Code:** Refactor, add documentation, implement features via prompts.
-   **Manage Repositories:** Find usages, manage version control (GitHub), and handle issues (Linear).
-   **Automate Tasks:** Streamline code reviews, generate boilerplate, and more.
-   **Coordinate via Integrations:** Seamlessly manage tasks across connected tools like GitHub and Linear, with Codegen handling the execution flow.

This creates a shared understanding where both humans and AI can express and execute complex code operations reliably.

## How Do You Interact?

You can command Codegen agents using natural language through various platforms:

-   **Slack:** Integrate directly into your team's conversations.
-   **GitHub:** Trigger agents via PR comments or actions.
-   **Linear:** Interact with agents within your issue tracking workflow.
-   **Web App:** Use our dedicated online interface.
-   **Python SDK:** Programmatically control agents via `agent.run(...)`.
-   **API:** Integrate agent capabilities into your own tools and services.
