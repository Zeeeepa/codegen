Navigate to your project's directory in your terminal. If you're using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage your project's dependencies, add Codegen:

```bash
uv add codegen
```

<Note>
If you don't have `uv` installed yet, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
</Note>

## Authentication

After installation, connect the CLI to your Codegen account:

```bash
codegen login
```

This will open your browser to authenticate and link your environment.

## Next Steps

Now that you're set up, head over to the **[Getting Started](/introduction/getting-started)** guide to learn how to use Codegen agents.
