The Codegen Python SDK provides a simple way to programmatically interact with Codegen agents from your own scripts and applications.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Installation:** Make sure you have the `codegen` package installed in your Python environment. Follow the steps in the [Installation guide](/introduction/installation).
2.  **Authentication:** Ensure you have authenticated the CLI by running `codegen login`. The SDK will use these credentials.

## Basic Usage

Running an agent involves importing the library, instantiating an `Agent`, and calling its `run` method with your prompt and target codebase.

```python
import codegen

# Ensure you are authenticated (run `codegen login` first)

# Instantiate the agent
agent = codegen.Agent()

# Define the prompt and target codebase
prompt = "Refactor the main function in main.py to be more modular and add docstrings."
# Can be a GitHub repo (owner/repo) or a local path
codebase_target = "your_github_username/your_repository_name" 
# codebase_target = "/path/to/your/local/project"

# Run the agent (add error handling in production)
result = agent.run(
    prompt=prompt,
    codebase=codebase_target
)

# Process the result
print("Agent run completed.")

# Example: Check if the agent created a Pull Request
if hasattr(result, 'pr_url') and result.pr_url:
    print(f"Pull Request created: {result.pr_url}")
else:
    # You might check other attributes or logs depending on the agent's task
    print("Check agent output or logs for more details.")

```

### Explanation

1.  **`import codegen`**: Imports the necessary library.
2.  **`agent = codegen.Agent()`**: Creates an instance of the Codegen agent.
3.  **`agent.run(prompt=..., codebase=...)`**: Executes the agent. 
    *   The `prompt` tells the agent what task to perform.
    *   The `codebase` specifies the target code, which can be a GitHub repository reference (`owner/repo`) or a path to a local directory.
4.  **`result`**: The object returned by `run` contains information about the execution outcome. This might include URLs (like `pr_url` if a pull request was generated), summaries of changes, or status indicators. The exact attributes depend on the task performed by the agent.

## Next Steps

With the SDK, you can integrate Codegen agents into your CI/CD pipelines, custom developer tools, or other automated workflows. Explore the different ways you can prompt the agent and leverage integrations like [Slack](/introduction/getting-started) and [Linear](/introduction/getting-started).
