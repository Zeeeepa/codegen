<Note>
  API access allows agents to interact with issues and projects according
  to your permissions in Linear.

## Capabilities

The Linear integration provides read and write access, enabling agents to manage tasks effectively:

- **Read Access:** Fetch issue details, read comments, view project status, list team members.
- **Write Access:** Update issue status (e.g., to "In Progress", "Done"), add comments, link GitHub PRs to issues, create new issues, assign tasks.
- **Multi Agent Systems:** Create sub-issues and assign child agents to break down complex tasks into manageable pieces. [Learn more](#multi-agent-systems).

## How Agents Use Linear

Agents use the Linear integration to streamline project management:

- **Track Work:** Automatically update the status of issues they are working on.
- **Link Code:** Connect implemented changes (GitHub PRs) directly to the relevant Linear issue.
- **Provide Updates:** Post comments on issues with progress reports, results, or questions.
- **Create Tasks:** Generate new issues for follow-up work, bugs discovered, or sub-tasks.

## Multi Agent Systems

### Overview

Once you've enabled linear self-assign in the settings [page](https://www.chadcode.sh/settings/permissions), a codegen agent, that has been assigned to a linear issue (or has been tagged in one), can spawn child agents
by creating sub-issues and assigning itself to those sub-issues. For each sub-issue that codegen assigns to itself a child agent will be spawned and tasked with completing the sub-issue. Once the child agents are
finished with their tasks they will notify their parent by sending it a message. The parent will then incorporate the child's work into its own as appropriate. 

### Best Practices

#### Triggering the Child Agents

If you'd like to have codegen break up a linear issue into smaller issues and assign them to child agents you should instruct it to do so in the
description of the original linear issue.

#### Shared Context

Before creating sub-issues and assigning them to child agents the parent agent will produce scaffolding in the form of a git branch and include details
of this branch in the description of the sub-issues. The child agents will then work off of this scaffolding branch. If you have specific scaffolding requirements
or context you'd like the child agents to share, please include them in the description of the parent issue.

#### Availability

This feature is only available on the Team Plan.
