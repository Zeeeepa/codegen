## Capabilities

The Linear integration provides read and write access, enabling agents to manage tasks effectively:

- **Read Access:** Fetch issue details, read comments, view project status, list team members.
- **Write Access:** Update issue status (e.g., to "In Progress", "Done"), add comments, link GitHub PRs to issues, create new issues, assign tasks.

## How Agents Use Linear

Agents use the Linear integration to streamline project management:

- **Track Work:** Automatically update the status of issues they are working on.
- **Link Code:** Connect implemented changes (GitHub PRs) directly to the relevant Linear issue.
- **Provide Updates:** Post comments on issues with progress reports, results, or questions.
- **Create Tasks:** Generate new issues for follow-up work, bugs discovered, or sub-tasks.
