AI is one of the most valuable collaborators for front-end modifications, UI updates, messaging, and crafting the aesthetic of what you're building. Codegen can now do serious work on both implementation and contributing to your design documentation, bridging the gap between design and code seamlessly.

## Capabilities

The Figma integration enables seamless design-to-code workflows:

- **Access design specifications** - Read design files, components, and detailed specifications
- **Extract design assets** - Pull images, icons, and visual elements for implementation
- **Convert designs to code** - Transform design mockups into functional frontend code
- **Sync design changes** - Stay updated with design iterations and modifications

## Permissions

The Codegen Figma integration requires the following permissions:

- **Read your profile and user information** - Access basic account details for authentication
- **Access file contents, nodes, and editor data** - Read design files and component structures
- **Read file metadata and version history** - Track design changes and version information
- **View file comments and discussions** - Understand design context and feedback
- **Access design variables and tokens** - Use consistent design system values
- **Read published components and styles** - Access shared design system components
- **Access team library content** - Use shared assets and design resources
- **List projects and project files** - Navigate and organize design files

## How Agents Use Figma

Agents leverage the Figma integration to:

- **Analyze Designs:** Examine design files to understand layout, styling, and component structure
- **Generate Code:** Convert Figma designs into HTML, CSS, React components, or other frontend code
- **Extract Assets:** Pull icons, images, and other visual assets needed for implementation
- **Maintain Design Systems:** Ensure code implementation follows design system guidelines and tokens
