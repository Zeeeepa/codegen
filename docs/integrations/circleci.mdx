Monitor and automatically fix failing CI checks with CircleCI integration. Codegen views check status, analyzes build logs, and automatically fixes issues when PRs fail. When Codegen creates a PR and checks fail, it will automatically wake up to investigate the logs and push fixes.

<Warning>
  CircleCI is currently available for enterprise customers. See
  [codegen.com/billing](https://codegen.com/billing) for more
</Warning>

## Capabilities

The CircleCI integration enables intelligent check monitoring and automatic issue resolution:

- **View broken checks and failures** - Monitor CI check status and identify specific failure points
- **Analyze build logs and error messages** - Grep through logs to understand root causes of failures
- **Automatically fix failing PRs** - Push corrective changes when checks fail on Codegen-created PRs
- **Wake up on check failures** - Automatically trigger when CI checks fail to investigate and resolve issues

## Permissions

The Codegen CircleCI integration requires the following permissions:

- **Read project information and settings** - Access pipeline configurations and project details
- **View build history and logs** - Monitor pipeline execution and analyze failure logs
- **Read test results and artifacts** - Access build outputs, test reports, and error details
- **Access check status and details** - Monitor CI check results and failure information

<Note>
  Codegen operates in read-only mode for CircleCI - it monitors and analyzes but
  does not trigger builds or modify CI configurations.
</Note>

## How Agents Use CircleCI

Agents leverage the CircleCI integration to:

- **Monitor Check Status:** Continuously watch for CI check failures on pull requests
- **Analyze Failure Logs:** Grep through build logs to identify specific errors, test failures, or build issues
- **Auto-Fix Issues:** When Codegen creates a PR and checks fail, it automatically investigates and pushes fixes
- **Prevent Broken Merges:** Ensure code quality by resolving CI failures before merge

## Automatic Wake-Up Behavior

When Codegen creates a pull request and CircleCI checks fail, Codegen will automatically:

1. **Detect the failure** - Monitor check status and identify when builds break
2. **Analyze the logs** - Grep through CircleCI logs to understand the specific failure
3. **Generate fixes** - Create targeted code changes to resolve the identified issues
4. **Push updates** - Automatically commit fixes to the same PR branch

This ensures that Codegen-created PRs maintain high quality and don't introduce breaking changes to your codebase.

## Installation

Connect your CircleCI account to Codegen to enable automatic check monitoring and issue resolution.

<Note>
  Ensure the agent has access to the specific CircleCI projects and
  organizations you want it to monitor.
