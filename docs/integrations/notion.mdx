Notion is your team's knowledge base, and now Codegen can tap into it too. Share PRDs, specs, and documentation with Codegen for technical feedback and implementation. A common workflow: pass a PRD to Codegen and it will provide technical insights, comment directly on the document, and then go implement the features described.

## Capabilities

The Notion integration enables seamless access to your team's knowledge base:

- **Access workspace documentation** - Read and analyze existing documentation, specs, and project requirements
- **Update pages and databases** - Modify content, add comments, and keep documentation current
- **Sync development information** - Bridge the gap between planning documents and code implementation
- **Generate knowledge base content** - Create new documentation based on development work and insights

## Permissions

The Codegen Notion integration requires the following permissions:

- **Read workspace content and documents** - Access existing pages, databases, and documentation
- **Update existing pages and documents** - Modify content and add comments for collaboration
- **Create new pages and content** - Generate new documentation and project materials
