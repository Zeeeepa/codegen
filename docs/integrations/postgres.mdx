<Note type="warning">
  For security reasons, it is strongly recommended to configure credentials with READ-ONLY access.
  Providing write access to automated agents could potentially lead to unintended data modifications
  or other negative consequences.
</Note>

## Capabilities

The Postgres integration provides secure database access enabling agents to:

- **Query Data:** Execute SELECT queries to fetch information from your database
- **Analyze Schema:** View table structures, relationships, and column definitions
- **Generate Reports:** Create data summaries and analysis based on query results

## How Agents Use Postgres

Agents leverage the Postgres integration to assist with data-related tasks:

- **Data Exploration:** Safely query your database to understand data structures and relationships
- **Report Generation:** Create data-driven reports and analytics
- **Schema Analysis:** Provide insights about database design and optimization
