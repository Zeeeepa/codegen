When your GitHub checks fail, Codegen automatically wakes up to analyze the failures and fix your PR. This intelligent system monitors CI status and proactively resolves issues without manual intervention.

<Tip>Codegen will try to fix broken checks 3x before "tapping out"</Tip>

## How Wake Up Works

Codegen continuously monitors your pull requests and automatically responds to check failures:

- **Automatic Detection:** Monitors GitHub check runs and CI status in real-time
- **Intelligent Analysis:** Analyzes build logs, test failures, and error messages to understand root causes
- **Targeted Fixes:** Generates specific code changes to resolve the identified issues
- **Persistent Retry:** Will attempt to fix issues up to 3 times per PR

## What Triggers Wake Up

Wake up activates when:

- **CI Checks Fail:** Any GitHub check run reports a failure status
- **Build Errors:** Compilation, linting, or build process failures
- **Test Failures:** Unit tests, integration tests, or automated test suites fail
- **Code Quality Issues:** Static analysis tools report violations or warnings

## The Auto-Fix Process

When Codegen wakes up to fix a failing PR, it follows this process:

1. **Detect Failure:** Monitor check status and identify when builds break
2. **Analyze Logs:** Grep through CI logs to understand specific failure points
3. **Generate Solution:** Create targeted code changes to resolve identified issues
4. **Apply Fix:** Automatically commit fixes to the same PR branch
5. **Re-validate:** Monitor the new check run to ensure the fix was successful

## Retry Logic

Codegen implements intelligent retry behavior:

- **Up to 3 attempts** per PR to resolve failing checks
- **Progressive analysis** - each retry incorporates learnings from previous attempts
- **Failure escalation** - if 3 attempts fail, the issue is flagged for human review

## GitHub Integration

The wake-up system integrates deeply with GitHub:

- **Check Run Annotations:** Creates detailed feedback with line-specific suggestions
- **PR Comments:** Adds contextual suggestions and explanations
- **Auto-Fix Actions:** Provides one-click fix buttons in the GitHub UI
- **Status Updates:** Real-time updates on fix progress and results

<Note>
  Wake up only activates for repositories where Codegen has write access and the
  feature is enabled. It respects your repository permissions and team
  workflows.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Context Switching:** No need to manually investigate and fix CI failures
- **Faster Iteration:** PRs get fixed automatically, keeping development velocity high
- **Learning from Failures:** Each fix improves Codegen's understanding of your codebase
- **24/7 Monitoring:** Works around the clock to keep your PRs in good shape
