}
```

## Agent Run Log Fields

Each log entry in the `logs` array contains the following fields:

### Core Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `agent_run_id` | integer | The ID of the agent run this log belongs to |
| `created_at` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp when the log entry was created |
| `message_type` | string | The type of log entry (see [Log Types](#log-types) below) |

### Agent Reasoning Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `thought` | string \| null | The agent's internal reasoning or thought process for this step |

### Tool Execution Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `tool_name` | string \| null | Name of the tool being executed (e.g., "ripgrep_search", "file_write") |
| `tool_input` | object \| null | JSON object containing the parameters passed to the tool |
| `tool_output` | object \| null | JSON object containing the tool's execution results |
| `observation` | object \| string \| null | The agent's observation of the tool execution results or other contextual data |

## Log Types

The `message_type` field indicates the type of log entry. Here are the possible values:

### Plan Agent Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ACTION` | The agent is executing a tool or taking an action |
| `PLAN_EVALUATION` | The agent is evaluating or updating its plan |
| `FINAL_ANSWER` | The agent is providing its final response or conclusion |
| `ERROR` | An error occurred during execution |
| `USER_MESSAGE` | A message from the user (e.g., interruptions or additional context) |
| `USER_GITHUB_ISSUE_COMMENT` | A comment from a GitHub issue that the agent is processing |

### PR Agent Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `INITIAL_PR_GENERATION` | The agent is generating the initial pull request |
| `DETECT_PR_ERRORS` | The agent is detecting errors in a pull request |
| `FIX_PR_ERRORS` | The agent is fixing errors found in a pull request |
| `PR_CREATION_FAILED` | Pull request creation failed |
| `PR_EVALUATION` | The agent is evaluating a pull request |

### Commit Agent Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `COMMIT_EVALUATION` | The agent is evaluating commits |

### Link Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `AGENT_RUN_LINK` | A link to another related agent run |

## Field Population Patterns

Different log types populate different fields:

### ACTION Logs
- Always have: `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `tool_output`
- Often have: `thought`, `observation`
- Example: Tool executions like searching code, editing files, creating PRs

### PLAN_EVALUATION Logs
- Always have: `thought`
- May have: `observation`
- Rarely have: Tool-related fields
- Example: Agent reasoning about next steps

### ERROR Logs
- Always have: `observation` (containing error details)
- May have: `tool_name` (if error occurred during tool execution)
- Example: Failed tool executions or system errors

### FINAL_ANSWER Logs
- Always have: `observation` (containing the final response)
- May have: `thought`
- Example: Agent's final response to the user

## Usage Examples

### Basic Log Retrieval

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.codegen.com/v1/organizations/67890/agent/run/12345/logs"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
data = response.json()

print(f"Agent run status: {data['status']}")
print(f"Total logs: {data['total_logs']}")

for log in data['logs']:
    print(f"[{log['created_at']}] {log['message_type']}: {log['thought']}")
```

### Filtering by Log Type

```python
# Get only ACTION logs to see tool executions
action_logs = [log for log in data['logs'] if log['message_type'] == 'ACTION']

for log in action_logs:
    print(f"Tool: {log['tool_name']}")
    print(f"Input: {log['tool_input']}")
    print(f"Output: {log['tool_output']}")
    print("---")
```

### Pagination Example

```python
# Get logs in batches of 50
skip = 0
limit = 50
all_logs = []

while True:
    url = f"https://api.codegen.com/v1/organizations/67890/agent/run/12345/logs?skip={skip}&limit={limit}"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    data = response.json()
    
    all_logs.extend(data['logs'])
    
    if len(data['logs']) < limit:
        break  # No more logs
    
    skip += limit

print(f"Retrieved {len(all_logs)} total logs")
```

### Debugging Failed Runs

```python
# Find error logs to debug issues
error_logs = [log for log in data['logs'] if log['message_type'] == 'ERROR']

for error_log in error_logs:
    print(f"Error at {error_log['created_at']}: {error_log['observation']}")
    if error_log['tool_name']:
        print(f"Failed tool: {error_log['tool_name']}")
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Building Monitoring Dashboards
Use the logs to create dashboards showing:
- Agent execution progress
- Tool usage patterns
- Error rates and types
- Execution timelines

### 2. Debugging Agent Behavior
Analyze logs to understand:
- Why an agent made certain decisions
- Where errors occurred in the execution flow
- What tools were used and their results

### 3. Audit and Compliance
Track agent actions for:
- Code change auditing
- Compliance reporting
- Security monitoring

### 4. Performance Analysis
Monitor:
- Tool execution times
- Common failure patterns
- Agent reasoning efficiency

## Rate Limits

- **60 requests per 60 seconds** per API token
- Rate limits are shared across all API endpoints

## Error Responses

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 400 | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API token |
| 403 | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| 404 | Not Found - Agent run not found |
| 429 | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
