# TypeScript Migration Plan for Codegen

This document outlines the plan for migrating the Codegen codebase from Python to TypeScript.

## Overview

The Codegen repository is currently a Python-based project with approximately 1165 Python files. This migration will convert the codebase to TypeScript, which will provide benefits such as static typing, better IDE support, and a more modern development experience.

## Migration Strategy

Given the size and complexity of the codebase, we'll adopt a phased approach to the migration:

### Phase 1: Setup and Infrastructure (Current PR)

- Set up TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
- Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Set up Jest for testing
- Create initial package.json with dependencies
- Implement a basic CLI structure to mirror the Python CLI

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Migration

- Identify and migrate core modules first
- Focus on the SDK and essential utilities
- Create TypeScript equivalents of Python classes and functions
- Implement type definitions for all data structures

### Phase 3: CLI Commands Migration

- Migrate each CLI command one by one
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing command-line usage
- Add comprehensive tests for each command

### Phase 4: Advanced Features Migration

- Migrate language server protocol (LSP) functionality
- Implement tree-sitter integration for code parsing
- Migrate code analysis and transformation features

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation

- Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- Validate functionality against the Python version
- Performance testing and optimization

### Phase 6: Documentation and Release

- Update documentation to reflect TypeScript usage
- Create migration guides for users
- Release the TypeScript version

## Directory Structure

The TypeScript version will follow a similar structure to the Python version:

```
src/
  cli/            # CLI commands and utilities
  sdk/            # Core SDK functionality
  lsp/            # Language Server Protocol implementation
  utils/          # Utility functions
  types/          # TypeScript type definitions
  parsers/        # Code parsing functionality
  transformers/   # Code transformation utilities
```

## Dependencies

The TypeScript version will use the following key dependencies:

- `commander` for CLI functionality
- `tree-sitter` and related parsers for code analysis
- `axios` for HTTP requests
- `fs-extra` for enhanced file system operations
- TypeScript and related development tools

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Python-specific Libraries**: Some Python libraries may not have direct TypeScript equivalents. We'll need to find alternatives or implement custom solutions.

2. **Performance**: Ensure the TypeScript version maintains or improves upon the performance of the Python version.

3. **Interoperability**: During the migration, we may need to maintain interoperability between Python and TypeScript components.

4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing will be crucial to ensure functionality is preserved.

## Next Steps

1. Review and merge this initial setup PR
2. Begin identifying core modules for migration
3. Create a detailed roadmap with milestones for each phase
4. Set up CI/CD for the TypeScript version

## Contributing to the Migration

Contributors can help with the migration by:

1. Identifying Python modules that can be migrated to TypeScript
2. Creating TypeScript equivalents of Python functions and classes
3. Writing tests for migrated functionality
4. Reviewing PRs related to the migration

## Timeline

The migration is expected to take several months, with regular releases of partially migrated functionality. The goal is to have a fully functional TypeScript version by the end of 2025.
