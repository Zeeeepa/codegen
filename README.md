[Codegen](https://docs.codegen.com) is a Python library for manipulating and analyzing codebases with a natural, intuitive API.

```python
from codegen import Codebase

# Codegen builds a complete graph connecting
# functions, classes, imports and their relationships
codebase = Codebase("./")

# Work with code without dealing with syntax trees or parsing
for function in codebase.functions:
    # Comprehensive static analysis for references, dependencies, etc.
    if not function.usages:
        # Auto-handles references and imports to maintain correctness
        function.move_to_file("deprecated.py")
```

Write code that transforms code. Codegen combines the parsing power of [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) with the graph algorithms of [rustworkx](https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx) to enable scriptable, multi-language code manipulation at scale.

## Features

- **Intuitive API**: Manipulate code with natural operations like `move`, `rename`, and `add_parameter`
- **Multi-language support**: Works with Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and React codebases
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Analyze dependencies, references, and relationships between code elements
- **Import management**: Automatically handles imports when moving or refactoring code
- **Scriptable transformations**: Create reusable scripts for common refactoring patterns
- **Enterprise-ready**: Scales to handle codebases with millions of lines of code

## Installation and Usage

We support:

- Running Codegen in Python 3.12 - 3.13 (recommended: Python 3.13+)
- macOS and Linux
  - macOS is supported
  - Linux is supported on x86_64 and aarch64 with glibc 2.34+
  - Windows is supported via WSL. See [here](https://docs.codegen.com/building-with-codegen/codegen-with-wsl) for more details.
- Python, TypeScript, JavaScript and React codebases

```bash
# Install inside existing project
uv pip install codegen

# Install global CLI
uv tool install codegen --python 3.13

# Create a codemod for a given repo
cd path/to/repo
codegen init
codegen create PATH test-function

# Run the codemod
codegen run test-function

# Create an isolated venv with codegen => open jupyter
codegen notebook
```

## Usage

See [Getting Started](https://docs.codegen.com/introduction/getting-started) for a full tutorial.

```python
from codegen import Codebase

# Initialize a codebase
codebase = Codebase("./")

# Find and manipulate functions
for function in codebase.functions:
    # Add type hints to parameters
    if function.name == "process_data" and not function.return_type:
        function.set_return_type("Dict[str, Any]")
        
    # Rename variables consistently
    for variable in function.variables:
        if variable.name == "data" and function.name.startswith("process_"):
            variable.rename("input_data")
            
# Move classes between files
user_class = codebase.classes.find(name="User")
if user_class:
    user_class.move_to_file("models/user.py")
    
# Add imports where needed
for py_file in codebase.files(extension=".py"):
    if "process_data" in py_file.content and "typing" not in py_file.imports:
        py_file.add_import("from typing import Dict, Any")
```

## Troubleshooting

Having issues? Here are some common problems and their solutions:

- **I'm hitting an UV error related to `[[ packages ]]`**: This means you're likely using an outdated version of UV. Try updating to the latest version with: `uv self update`.
- **I'm hitting an error about `No module named 'codegen.sdk.extensions.utils'`**: The compiled cython extensions are out of sync. Update them with `uv sync --reinstall-package codegen`.
- **I'm hitting a `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded` error while parsing my codebase**: If you are using python 3.12, try upgrading to 3.13. If you are already on 3.13, try upping the recursion limit with `sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)`.

## Why Codegen?

Software development is fundamentally programmatic. Refactoring a codebase, enforcing patterns, or analyzing control flow - these are all operations that can (and should) be expressed as programs themselves.

We built Codegen backwards from real-world refactors performed on enterprise codebases. Instead of starting with theoretical abstractions, we focused on creating APIs that match how developers actually think about code changes:

- **Natural mental model**: Write transforms that read like your thought process - "move this function", "rename this variable", "add this parameter". No more wrestling with ASTs or manual import management.

- **Battle-tested on complex codebases**: Handle Python, TypeScript, and React codebases with millions of lines of code.

- **Built for advanced intelligences**: As AI developers become more sophisticated, they need expressive yet precise tools to manipulate code. Codegen provides a programmatic interface that both humans and AI can use to express complex transformations through code itself.
