[Codegen](https://docs.codegen.com) is a python library for manipulating codebases. 🐍

```python 💡
from codegen import Codebase 🧩

# Codegen builds a complete graph connecting 🔄
# functions, classes, imports and their relationships 🔗
codebase = Codebase("./") 📂

# Work with code without dealing with syntax trees or parsing 🌳
for function in codebase.functions: 🔍
    # Comprehensive static analysis for references, dependencies, etc. 🔬
    if not function.usages: 🚫
        # Auto-handles references and imports to maintain correctness ✅
        function.move_to_file("deprecated.py") 📋
```

Write code that transforms code. Codegen combines the parsing power of [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) with the graph algorithms of [rustworkx](https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx) to enable scriptable, multi-language code manipulation at scale. 🔄

## Installation and Usage 📥

We support 🛠️

- Running Codegen in Python 3.12 - 3.13 (recommended: Python 3.13+) 🐍
- macOS and Linux 💻
  - macOS is supported 🍎
  - Linux is supported on x86_64 and aarch64 with glibc 2.34+ 🐧
  - Windows is supported via WSL. See [here](https://docs.codegen.com/building-with-codegen/codegen-with-wsl) for more details. 🪟
- Python, Typescript, Javascript and React codebases 🧰

``` 📝
# Install inside existing project 🏗️
uv pip install codegen 📦

# Install global CLI 🌐
uv tool install codegen --python 3.13 🛠️

# Create a codemod for a given repo 🔧
cd path/to/repo 📂
codegen init ✨
codegen create test-function 🧪

# Run the codemod 🚀
codegen run test-function ▶️

# Create an isolated venv with codegen => open jupyter 🧠
codegen notebook 📓
```

## Usage 🔧

See [Getting Started](https://docs.codegen.com/introduction/getting-started) for a full tutorial. 📚

``` 💻
from codegen import Codebase 🧩
```

## Troubleshooting 🔍

Having issues? Here are some common problems and their solutions: 🛠️

- **I'm hitting an UV error related to `[[ packages ]]`**: This means you're likely using an outdated version of UV. Try updating to the latest version with: `uv self update`. 🔄
- **I'm hitting an error about `No module named 'codegen.sdk.extensions.utils'`**: The compiled cython extensions are out of sync. Update them with `uv sync --reinstall-package codegen`. 🔄
- **I'm hitting a `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded` error while parsing my codebase**: If you are using python 3.12, try upgrading to 3.13. If you are already on 3.13, try upping the recursion limit with `sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)`. 🔄

## Why Codegen? 🤔

Software development is fundamentally programmatic. Refactoring a codebase, enforcing patterns, or analyzing control flow - these are all operations that can (and should) be expressed as programs themselves. 💡

We built Codegen backwards from real-world refactors performed on enterprise codebases. Instead of starting with theoretical abstractions, we focused on creating APIs that match how developers actually think about code changes: 🧠

- **Natural mental model**: Write transforms that read like your thought process - "move this function", "rename this variable", "add this parameter". No more wrestling with ASTs or manual import management. 🧩

- **Battle-tested on complex codebases**: Handle Python, TypeScript, and React codebases with millions of lines of code. 💪

- **Built for advanced intelligences**: As AI developers become more sophisticated, they need expressive yet precise tools to manipulate code. Codegen provides a programmatic interface that both humans and AI can use to express complex transformations through code itself. 🤖
